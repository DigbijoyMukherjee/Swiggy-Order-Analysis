# Swiggy Order Analysis
About this project
PROJECT SUMMARY
This project required the analysis of one years worth of transactional data for a pizza restaurant in Mumbai. The main objective was to find operational opportunities to increase efficiency and drive more sales.

Skills Used:
SQL to analyze the data and Tableau for visualization

Desired Insights
How many customers do we have each day? Are there any peak hours?
How many pizzas are typically in an order? Do we have any bestsellers?
How much money did we make this year? Can we indentify any seasonality in the sales?
Are there any pizzas we should take of the menu, or any promotions we could leverage?
Data Prep
The data was contained in 4 csv files. MySQL workbench was my IDE of choice and I created 4 tables and uploaded the corresponding csv's to the tables that were created. See the additional images to view the SQL code.

Visualizing the Data
Tableau was the BI tool I choose to use. I was able to experiment with creating a top and bottom set and then combining them to make the Top 5 and Bottom 5 pizzas sold chart. I also created some LOD calculations but ended up not using them in the viz.

Key Takeaways
Lunch time during the weekday is the busiest time followed closely by the weekend dinner time hours
The hoidays of July 4th and Thanksgiving drive the most orders on a daily basis
The Chicken category is the highest grossing with top 3 spots in revenue
The Brie Carre pizza needs to be removed from the menu
